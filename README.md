# Payroll-Automator
## Project Overview
This repository contains a Flask-based payroll automation system that calculates employee payroll in compliance with the 2025 Kenyan tax laws. It automates salary computations, statutory deductions (PAYE, SHIF, NSSF, AHL), and generates professional PDF payslips and a P10 csv.

The project is designed to eliminate manual errors, save processing time, and ensure regulatory compliance for SMEs, accounting firms, and HR departments.
### Goal
The main goal of this project is to:
1. Obtain the titles and prices of at least 10 books.
2. Convert book prices from foreign currency (GBP) into a local currency (KES) for easier analysis.
3. Store the results in a JSON file.
